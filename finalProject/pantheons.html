                <h2>Greek Pantheon</h2>
                <p>
                    When the world was still young and the sea had not yet learned its tides, the Greeks told of a time before time- when Chaos breathed out darkness, and from that darkness rose the first shapes of the universe. They say Gaia, the
                    Earth herself, was the first to awaken. Her heartbeat became the echo found in every mountain. Her breath became wind. Her tears the first rivers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The gods who came after - Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hera, Demeter, Hestia - were not gentle beings. They were carved from thunder and fire, shaped by betrayal and prophecy. Their stories are scars written across the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zeus, crowned after a war that shattered the sky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Poseidon, builder of storms, forever wrestling with the anger inside him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hades, silent lord of the underworld, ruling not with cruelty but with solemn duty.
                </p>                 
                <p>
                    Athena, wise-born from Zeus' skull, strategist of cities and battles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ares, the raw, brutal force of war.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Artemis, mistress of the untamed wilds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apollo, light-bringer, patron of music and prophecy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To walk among these gods was to walk in a world where every lightning bolt carried a message, and every calm sea
                    could
                    hide a wrath older than civilization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mortals feared the gods- but they also loved them. For the Greek gods were flawed, passionate, and painfully
                    human.
                    And that is why their stories survive: because in them, humanity sees itself, magnified into myth.

                <h2>Roman Pantheon</h2>
                <p>
                    Rome did not invent its gods — it reshaped them. Refined them like metal under the hammer of empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where the Greeks imagined gods with brilliant emotions, the Romans imagined gods with purpose.
                    Every god had an office, a role, a sacred duty written into the bones of the Republic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jupiter, father of thunder, stood as guardian of law and kingly power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Juno, protectress of marriage and women, fierce and watchful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neptune, ruler of the deep, feared by sailors who crossed Roman waters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mars was not merely war — he was the father of Rome, a noble general, sacred to farmers as well as soldiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Minerva guided artisans, scholars, inventors, the clever hands and clever minds who drove Roman progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Venus, radiant and dangerous, claimed ancestry over Roman emperors themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their world was one of omens: the flight of birds, the sound of thunder, the trembling of the earth beneath
                    marching
                    soldiers. Every sign was a message.
                    The Romans believed the gods supported them — but only if Rome lived with discipline and respect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the empire grew, Roman gods marched with their legions. Their temples rose in distant lands, their
                    festivals echoed
                    across continents.
                    The Roman pantheon became not just a collection of deities — but the spiritual spine of the empire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even after Rome fell, its gods left fingerprints on law, language, astronomy, and the calendar itself.
                    Their legacy is not lost — merely woven into the world.

                <h2>Egyptian Pantheon</h2>
                <p>
                    The Egyptians did not see life as a straight line — they saw it as a great circle, a loop of rebirth and memory.
                    Their gods reflected this: ancient, ageless, intertwined with the rhythm of the Nile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, they say the waters of Nun stretched endlessly. From their surface rose Ra, the sun itself.
                    Each morning he sailed across the sky, and each night he descended into the underworld to fight the serpent
                    Apophis, who sought to swallow the sun forever. This battle — light versus chaos — happened every night, unseen
                    by mortal eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Osiris, beloved king, ruled the fertile lands and taught humans to farm. His murder at the hands of his jealous
                    brother Set shook the foundations of the world. But Osiris' queen, Isis, powerful in her magic and devotion,
                    restored her husband long enough to conceive Horus, the falcon prince destined to reclaim the throne.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each pharaoh that ruled after was believed to be Horus on earth, Osiris in death, part of a divine lineage older
                    than history itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anubis, jackal-headed and silent, guarded the realm of the dead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thoth, the ibis-scribe, wrote the laws of creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bastet, protector of hearth and home, watched over families with gentle claws.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the Egyptians, the gods were not distant. They lived in statues, temples, amulets, the wind that cooled the
                    desert, the flood that renewed the soil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their pantheon is a story of cycles: birth, death, renewal. A reminder that nothing truly ends — it simply
                    changes form.

                <h2>Norse Pantheon</h2>
                <p>
                    If Greek gods were passionate and Roman gods dutiful, the Norse gods were warriors walking toward a fate they
                    could not avoid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the frozen north, under skies lit by dancing auroras, the Norse told of a cosmos forged from fire and ice. In
                    the void between them, life sparked: giants of frost, gods of war, wolves as large as mountains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Odin, one-eyed wanderer, traded sight for wisdom and blood for prophecy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thor, red-bearded thunderer, protected gods and mortals alike from giants lurking beyond the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loki, unpredictable trickster, a flame that warms or burns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Freyja, queen of beauty and war, collecting fallen warriors for her own hall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tyr, the brave, who placed his hand in Fenrir's jaws to bind the great wolf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heimdall, ever-watchful, hearing grass grow and stones whisper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Norse gods were strong- but they were not immortal in the way others were.
                    They knew Ragnarök would one day come. They knew which gods would fall, which monsters would rise, and which
                    fires would consume the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And yet… they fought anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the heart of the Norse pantheon: Not endless triumph, but courage in the face of destiny. To live fully,
                    even when the end is written.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their stories are storms: violent, tragic, beautiful.
